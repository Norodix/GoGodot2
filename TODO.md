## Energy Streamer
    
    - [ ] Create energy nodes
        - [x] Common property energy
        - [ ] Custom behaviour, fire size, boiling stream etc.
        - [ ] Create animations
        - [ ] Visualize current energy level on scale
        - [ ] Nodes
            - [ ] Cauldron
            - [x] Fire
            - [x] Rising platform
            - [x] Horizontally bouncing/moving platform/springing
            - [ ] Lamp
            - [ ] Negative energy/direct energy out from water to freeze it
            - [ ] Vibrating bouncy platform
    - [x] Create connection handler
        - [x] Detect energy nodes based on collision layer and energy property
        - [x] Handle unhandled inputs in all scenes
        - [x] Handle connection graphics (line/spline)
        - [x] Drive the energy transfer in the process function
    - [x] Implement or import character controller
    - [ ] Implement tilemap for levels https://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer
    - [ ] Design good levels
    - [ ] Sound design
    - [ ] Implement Level selector, menu and level end target

## Level ideas
    - Vertically narrow corridor, many horizontal oscillators, have to set one by one
    - Cauldron lift up/ basic platform lift up
    - Need to find place to dump energy instead of sourcing it

## Other/Optional

    - [ ] Automate itch uploads
    - [ ] Mobile controls, animation tests etc
